    href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive/vo/">HEASARC</a> -
    VO access to all HEASARC catalog information is built into the
    standard HEASARC infrastructure.  Over 800 catalogs are queryable
    through VO Cone Search and the Table Access Protocol.  VOTable
    format returns are supported through all of our interfaces not
    just VO protocols. There is currently no VO access to data on a
    per observation basis.  VO access to many survey data sets,
    including surveys generated from entire mission observations, is
    available through our SkyView Virtual Telescope facility.  This
    supports Simple Image access queries to all included surveys.
    Information about VO resources at the HEASARC is published using a
    VO publishing registry which is updated periodically using
    semiautomatic processes.</p>

        <p>The HEASARC provides access to a variety of types of tables
        including mission master tables, instruments tables, object
        tables, and domain master catalogs.  SkyView provides access
        to a variety of all-sky and more limited survey datasets in
        all wavelength regimes from radio through gamma rays.  Catalog
        access is provided through the VO Cone Search and Table Access
        Protocols.  More information on the HEASARC's services can be
        found <a
        href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive/vo/">here</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p><a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/voapi.html">IRSA</a>
    - IRSA offers program-friendly interfaces to all of its
    holdings. Through an Application Program Interface (API), users
    can access IRSA data directly (within a script or on the command
    line) without the need to go through interactive web-based user
    interfaces. Each API is a set of programming instructions for
    accessing one of IRSA's services. These APIs allow users to write
    software that can talk to IRSA's software to carry out queries and
    download data, with no user intervention.</p>

        <p>The program interface involves constructing URL
        queries. The commands wget and curl are commonly used for
        automating these queries, so API users may wish to begin by
        installing one of these packages. The IDL astro library also
        includes a routine to query IRSA catalogs through IDL.
        Detailed instructions are available for <a
        href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interface/api_catalogs.html">catalogs</a>,
        <a

    <li><p><a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/vo/">MAST</a> - MAST is
    working to make its data compliant with the current VO
    standards. Data holdings can be searched using HTML search forms
    and applications such as Aladin, Datascope, and Specview, and also
    using HTTP GET requests, allowing the search parameters to be
    included in the URL. Many examples can be found on the <a
    href="http://archive.stsci.edu/vo/mast_services.html">MAST Web
    Services</a> page.</p>

        <p>MAST mission data collections are available through several
        standard VO Services, these are primarily used to support
        spatial position searches: Cone Search, Simple Image Access
        (SIA), Simple Spectral Access (SSA).  MAST is currently in the
        process of completing the development of Table Access Protocol
        (TAP) services.</p></li>

    <li><p><a href="http://vo.ned.ipac.caltech.edu/">NED</a> - NED is
    a comprehensive database of multiwavelength data for extragalactic
    objects, providing a systematic, ongoing fusion of information
    integrated from hundreds of large sky surveys and tens of
    thousands of research publications. The contents and services span
    the entire observed spectrum from gamma rays through radio
    frequencies. As new observations are published, they are
    cross-identified or statistically associated with previous data
    and integrated into a unified database to simplify queries and
    retrieval. Seamless connectivity is also provided to data in NASA
    astrophysics mission archives (IRSA, HEASARC, MAST), to the
    astrophysics literature via ADS, and to other data centers around
    the world.</p>

        <p>Objects can be queried <a
        href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/forms/byname.html">By
        Name</a>, <a
        href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/forms/nearname.html">Near

        sources that are not yet cross-matched with NED
