<p>NAVO is a member of <a
href="https://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/USVOA/" target="_blank">US
Virtual Observatory Alliance (USVOA)</a>, a US-wide open collaboration
endorsed by the <a href="http://aas.org/" target="_blank">American
Astronomical Society</a> to expand and promote VO tools and services.
The NAVO IVOA Liaison is a member of the USVOA Executive Committee,
currently chaired by Dr. G. Fabbiano (SAO).</p>

<p>The USVOA was convened to represent the US in the <a
href="http://www.ivoa.net/" target="_blank">International Virtual
Observatory Alliance (IVOA)</a>, the global effort to facilitate VO
standards and goals, and whose membership is open only to national
organizations. Seventeen countries are currently members of the
IVOA. The NAVO IVOA Liaison is one of three US members of the IVOA
Executive Committee, and his or her remit is to represent the
interests of NAVO within the IVOA, and to sustain US leadership within
the IVOA.</p>

<p>As one of the founding members of the IVOA in 2002,
the US has always had a strong leadership role in the IVOA. This
leadership role continues today: the US holds eight leadership
positions within the various groups responsible for performing the
technical work.</p>
