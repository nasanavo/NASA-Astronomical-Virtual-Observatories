<h2> What kinds of data are available? </h2>

<p>The detailed holdings for each mission stored in the NAVO archives are
given in our <a href=resources.html>resources table</a>.  Here we
describe the general categories of data available and how you might
get to them.  What can you find?</p>

<p>For most missions, the mission data is divided in temporally
bounded observations.  Details vary from mission to mission, but there
are typically a time range, exposure, position, target, investigator,
and instrument configuration associated with the observation.  You can
get <b>Observation tables</b> which provide a summary of the mission.
These allow you to see if there is coverage regions and/or times of
interest with the instrument characteristics you are interested in.
If you really just looking to seeing if there is spatial coverage then
the simple cone search protocol is all you need.  Otherwise you may
wish to do more sophisticated queries using the general table access
protocol (TAP).  </p>


<p> For many missions a major data product is an object catalog (or
catalogs) derived from systematic analysis of the observations.  The
astronomer can often use the information in these catalogs without
needing to reference the observations directly.  Such catalogs are
typical in imaging missions with reasonably high resolution.
<b>Object tables</b> may include both observational constraints and
measured values.  Some missions may have multiple object catalogs
reflecting difference aspects of the mission.  As with the observation
catalogs you can query these with either cone or TAP queries depending
upon whether you need just a spatial match or have more complex search
criteria.  </p>

<p> All of the archives provide interfaces that allow users to
retrieve <b>observation images</b>.  These are the actual images
associated with specific observations but may only be available for
higher levels of processing.  For some missions, the basic images are
not taken as discrete observations but are generated in post
processing.  These interfaces are are currently queryable using
version 1 of the simple image access protocol which supports
positional queries. Upgrades to version 2 which will support more
complex criteria are scheduled for the coming years.  <p>

<p> MAST provides a spectral interface to access <b>spectral data</b>
for spectrometer based missions and for the HST spectrometer
instruments. This uses the simple spectral interface document and
supports queries by position, wavelength and several other criteria.
Spectral interfaces are planned at IRSA and NED.

<p> MAST, IRSA, and the HEASARC provide many <b>image services for
specific regions</b> of the sky or associated with specific objects.
Certain regions of the sky have many specialized services associated
with them.  They typically do not provide access to the full mission
dataset but are often more highly processed.

<p>Other images services are direct <b>cut-out capabilities</b> where
the user can specify a particular region of the interest and will get
results of that area is in the mission coverage region.  IRSA provides
a standard cutout service for its imaging missions.  MAST provides
cutouts for several key datasets.  At the HEASARC, the SkyView service
provides cutout capabilities for over 100 sky datasets.  NED's imaging
service provides a combination of cutouts and observations associated
with specific objects.</p>

<p> Each of the resources described above is indexed in a common
registry of resources maintained at MAST.  Users can search this
<b>metadata</b> directly using the <a
href=http://vao.stsci.edu/directory>Directory</a> service.  This is
used by many VO-enabled tools but users may sometimes find it useful
to explore the detailed metadata associated with tables and other
services.
