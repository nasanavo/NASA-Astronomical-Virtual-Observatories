<p>The page summarizes the Virtual Observatory (VO) capabilities of
NASA astronomical archives.  You can also see a comprehensive listing
on the <a href="resources.html">resources page</a>.  The Virtual
Observatory is a set of data services that have adopted standards to
facilitate the dissemination of astronomical data, using rules agreed
upon by the <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/">International Virtual
Observatory Alliance (IVOA)</a>. Data can now be acquired using
protocols which allow users to retrieve data in VOTable formatted xml
files. This system provides an alternative to data extraction via
conventional astronomical catalog interfaces. </p> 

<p>The NAVO collaboration has developed framework to use VO interfaces
to provide comprehensive and consistent access to NASA data.  This
interface concept is described in <a href=NAVO_spie.pdf>our
presentation to the 2016 SPIE</a> while the specific implementations
are noted in this page and the linked <a href=resources.html>mission
table</a>.</p>

<p>A general summary of NAVO is presented in our <a
href="ADASS2015Presentation.pdf">ADASS poster</a> from October 2015.
The <a href="NASAVOCapabilitiesV2.0.pdf">annual report</a> on the
state of NAVO archives was released on February 2015 and our initial
plan for implementation of a common interface was given in June
2015. </p>
