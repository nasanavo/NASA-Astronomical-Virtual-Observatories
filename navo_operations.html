        <h2>NAVO Operations: Registry, VO Monitoring and Usage of NAVO interfaces</h2>
        <div class="full-width-content-item"> 
<h3> Registry Operations </h3>

<p> MAST operates the NAVO VO registry.  This is a database which
stores information about VO services published worldwide.  The
registry is used by many VO-aware tools but can be queried manually
using the <a href=http://vao.stsci.edu/directory>Directory</a>
service.  Just enter keywords describing the data of interest.  </p>

<h3> Monitoring and Validation </h3> 

<p>The HEASARC runs services which monitor and validate the operation of
    VO services worldwide.</p>

<p> Every site is tested on an hourly cadence
and checked to make sure that a sensible response is received.  The
goal of the monitoring activity is to see if the site is up, not to do
a detailed quality check.  Monitoring checks are lightweight and done
only on representative services to ensure minimal loading on the
remote sites.  Web pages are available to look at the <a
href=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/vo/monitor> current status</a> of
services or to get the average uptime for a <a
href=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/vo/monitor/stats.html>time
range</a>.  When services fail, NAVO personnel send messages to the
responsible parties.  </p> 

<p> Validation is a more intensive check of the conformance of
services to VO standards.  About 3% of services are validated each day
so that all services are validated over the course of a month.  The
results of validation are available through the <a
href=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/vo/validation>validation website</a>
which allows users to drill down to the validation status of a
particular service, or to look at the issues with a site or protocol
overall.</p>

<h3>Usage of VO Protocols at NASA Archives</h3>

<p> Weekly statistics for the rate of VO usage are collected by all
 NAVO centers.  Each query using a VO protocol is counted shown in the
 figure below.</p>
