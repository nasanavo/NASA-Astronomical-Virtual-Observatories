                            <h2>Python Notebooks</h2>
                            <div class="full-width-content-item"> 
<p>We supply a number of Python notebooks, giving concrete examples on
how to query our archives with specific use pages.</p>

<p><b>NASA-NAVO Services</b></p>

<ul> 

<li><p>If you need to combine data from multiple archives, this
example uses python to put together and analyze a multiwavelength data
set. This example uses a sample of interacting galaxies and assembles
a multiwavelength data set for it. This can be generalized to a much
larger data set.  (<a target="_blank"

<p><b>HEASARC</b></p>

<ul>

<li><p>If you would like to go through a specific science case, this
notebook goes through a number of examples for accessing HEASARC data,
including catalogs, images and spectra, using various VO
protocols. This notebook presents the broad summary of the available
protocols. More details are available in separate notebooks using
various VO protocols.  (<a target="_blank"

or download from GitHub</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>If you need to access VO tables from the HEASARC archive, this
notebook shows how to list, fetch and look at VO tables and also how
to create your own VO Table, which can be used to cross-correlate with
other VO Tables.  (<a target="_blank"

or download from GitHub</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>If you need to perform a simple cone search of HEASARC
catalogs, this example goes through finding out what catalogs are
available for cone searches or search a given table with a given
position and radius, getting a VOTable XML result.  (<a

<li><p>This example shows how to search for and retrieve images from
the HEASARC's holdings.  (<a target="_blank"

<li><p>This example shows how to search for and retrieve spectra from
the HEASARC's holdings.  (<a target="_blank"

or download from GitHub</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>If you need to access HEASARC tables through the TAP with ADQL,
this example expands on using Table Access Protocol (TAP) and the
Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL) that it uses.  (<a

<p><b>IRSA</b></p>

<ul>

<li><p>If you need to access data from infrared or submillimeter
missions or data from related projects, the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science
Archive (IRSA) holds these products. These include data from pointed
observatories such as Spitzer and Herschel, as well as large-area and
all-sky surveys such as 2MASS, WISE, IRAS, Planck, and AKARI. In
total, IRSA provides access to more than 20 billion astronomical
measurements, including all-sky coverage in 24 bands. This example
shows how to perform a catalog search of those products. (<a

<p><b>MAST</b></p>

<ul>

<li><p>MAST CAOM Tap Example - This notebook shows how to use the MAST
CAOM Tap service.  (<a target="_blank"

or download from GitHub</a>)</li>

<li><p>Notebook for accessing MAST SIA services - This notebook shows
how to use Virtual Observatory (VO) services to find and retrieve
images from the MAST archive. Since these queries use VO protocols,
they are not specific to MAST, and can be used to find and retrieve
images from other VO data providers.  (<a target="_blank"

<li><p>New notebook with more details about searching the registry -
NAVO has an instance of an IVOA Registry known as the NAVO
Directory. This directory can be searched for resources that may be
applicable to a particular scientific problem. The registry can be
searched via a web page or programmatically.  (<a target="_blank"
