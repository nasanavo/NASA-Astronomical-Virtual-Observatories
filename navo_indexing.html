                            <h2>NAVO Study of Indexing of Large Tables</h2>
                            <div class="full-width-content-item"> 
<p>One of the most complex challenges facing the future of the NASA
archive data centers is providing rapid access to very large catalogs
of sources stored in databases. These catalogs nearly always include
the spatial positions of sources and require intelligent and scalable
queries to search and discover datasets. The selection of indexing
method is a crucial part of the design of a database, yet there is not
collection of benchmarks that record the performance of various
indexing schemes that will allow database architects make informed
choices of indexing schemes. Such is the purpose of this study, a
collaboration between IPAC and STScI.</p>

<p> Based on the results of a
<a href=NAVO_Indexes_Overview_v1.1.pdf>survey of indexing methods used
in astronomy by Greene et al. (2015)</a>, we have determined that the
benchmarking will initially use the Postgres database, and we will
derive benchmarks that show how query speed varies with the HTM and
HEALPix indexing methods, and the index bin sizes (arcsecond,
arcminute, etc.) and with size of search region, and how query times
compare with database I/O times. The study will examine performance
for catalogs with uniform sky coverage (2MASS) and locally dense
coverage (WFPC2).</p>

<p> To date, we have developed and evaluated a
C-based toolkit for adding indices to a Postgres table, running
cone-search and caption timing information. First results to be added
soon.</p>
